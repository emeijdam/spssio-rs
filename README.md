# SPSSIO_RS

Ergonomic Rust bindings for the SPSSIO C Module, generated using the excelent rust bindgen.

Inspired by the duckdb-rs crate.

IBM SPSS Statistics 29 Module

# Status
This is a work in progress, but the basic functionality for writing and reading SPSS files is working.

## Why Rust?
GenAi: Modern data science and machine learning applications require a high-performance, safe, and reliable programming language. Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Rust is a great choice for building high-performance applications that require low-level control over system resources. 

Me the dev: Cause I like Rust programming, especially with the great Cargo Toolchain. It makes programming fun again.


## Why SPSSIO?

use spssio_rs::SpssIO;

fn main() {
    let spss_io = SpssIO::new();
    let file = spss_io.open("data.sav");
    let data = file.read();
    println!("{:?}", data);
}
```

## Installation

## Building for OSX.
As far I know, IBM is working on a IBM SPSS v30 version for Apple Silicon, meanwhile we compile for Rosetta.
