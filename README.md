# SPSSIO-RS

Ergonomic Rust bindings for the SPSSIO C Module, generated using the excelent rust [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

Inspired by the duckdb-rs crate.

[IBM SPSS Statistics 29 IO Module](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ai-datascience/viewdocument/extensions-tools-and-utilities-for?CommunityKey=886b6874-0fb1-402c-8243-c70ef8179a99&tab=librarydocuments)

## Usage

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use spssio::SPSSFile;

fn main()-> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>{
    let myfile = SPSSFile::open_write("output.sav")?;

    myfile.set_var_name("var1", 0)?;
    myfile.set_var_label("var1", "Variable 1")?;

    myfile.commit_header()?;

    myfile.set_value_numeric("var1", 123.45)?;
    myfile.commit_case_record()?;
    
    myfile.set_value_numeric("var1", 678.90)?;
    myfile.commit_case_record()?;

    myfile.close_write()?;

}
```

More examples can be found in the examples folder.

# Status
This is a work in progress, but the basic functionality for writing and reading SPSS files is working for OSX Rosetta and Windows.

## Why Rust?
GenAi: Modern data science and machine learning applications require a high-performance, safe, and reliable programming language. Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Rust is a great choice for building high-performance applications that require low-level control over system resources. 

Me the dev: Cause I like Rust programming, especially with the great Cargo Toolchain. It makes programming fun again.

## Building on and for OSX.
As far I know, IBM is working on a IBM SPSS v30 version for Apple Silicon, meanwhile we compile for Rosetta.
